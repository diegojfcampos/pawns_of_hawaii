            <p class="adopt-text">View the dogs available for adoption on our website and register your interest in a specific dog. You can also visit the shelter to speak with a member of the adoptions team about finding a suitable dog. Please note that registering your interest is not a waiting list and you will not be contacted after submitting your application. It is simply to speed up the adoption process during your visit to the shelter.
            If you applied for a specific dog and your application is accepted, an adoption consultant will discuss the adoption process in more detail with you during your visit to the shelter. If you already have a dog, an appointment will be made for a "dog meet."
            If you are visiting the shelter during walk-in hours (12-4pm Tues-Sun), our site is dog-friendly and you are welcome to bring your dog with you. However, please note that you cannot bring your dog inside the main rehoming kennels. We recommend bringing a second person who can hold your dog outside or visit our on-site Ruff Cafe while you look at the dogs available for adoption.
            Once your application has been processed and approved, you may be able to take the dog home for a week-long foster period. Photo ID and proof of address are required for this, as well as a refundable reservation donation.
            After the foster week is complete, you must attend an adoption meeting with a member of the adoptions team. These meetings are by appointment only and held on certain days.
